        <h1>Story</h1>
        <p>Imagine a world just like our own. In this world one small mistake in a research lab creates a zombie virus. Unfortunately the zombies are very effective at spreading their disease and what is worse is that the virus has an incubation period. Because of this, the virus spreads rapidly across the country and the world. Simply put, there is no stopping the zombies. </p>
        <p>Or, there might be another world where the exact same thing happens, but this time the infection doesnâ€™t spread as quickly. Its parameter set is different and though it has some initial success it ultimately dies out. </p>
        <p>Depending on the choices you the user make about the spreading rate and kill rate of this disease, we will see different zombie dynamics. Pick a spot on land, set up the parameters, and hit the start button to see the world slowly over run in the zombie apocalypse. </p>
        <p>Also, try out the Konami Code to fight back</p>

        <h1>Interesting Results</h1>
        <p>One very notable thing was how, when diseases started in China, they spread really quickly to the United States.</p>
        <p>vacation spots and tourist destinations seemed to be overridden with zombies the fastest (sorry Harvard).</p>
        <p>Diseases starting in the US tend to head towards the UK very quickly.</p>
